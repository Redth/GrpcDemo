# GrpcDemo

This demo contains a .NET 6 MAUI app, an ASP.NET Core server, and a shared library.

The MAUI app retrieves data from the server using gRPC streaming.

It works with Windows and Android. As of this writing I can retrieve a message on iOS, but streaming doesn't work. No exceptions. it just blows up.
